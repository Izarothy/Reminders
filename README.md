# Reminders app

It's a simple desktop app made with Electron. Initially you see a form with 3 fields: the title, interval and amount of a reminder you want to have set. When you submit, you can minimize the window and it'll remind you that often and that many times of what you have to do. If there's no reminders left, it'll close itself.

# Technology stack:

- Electron
- React
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- Typescript
- Bootstrapped with Create Nextron App
- Jest (React Testing Library, JestDOM)
